* Derives all of the properties of a Red-Black Tree
* Added node attribute:
	- Size: Number of internal nodes rooted at a given Node x, including x
		- X.Size = X.Left.Size + X.Right.Size + 1
	- Default Constructor: Initializes Size = 0
		- Used by OrderStatisticTree's NIL
	- Constructor with a Data parameter: Initializes Size = 1
		- Logically equivalent to x.Size = x.Left.Size + x.Right.Size
		  + 1 operation, where x is the constructed Node and x.Left
and x.Right both point to NIL
* Modifications to OrderStatisticsTree RedBlack Tree derived Methods:
	- LeftRotate adds:
		- y.Size = x.Size
		- x.Size = X.Left.Size + X.Right.Size
	- RightRotate adds:		
		- y.Size = x.Size
		- x.Size = X.Left.Size + X.Right.Size
	- Insert adds:
		- Updates parent pointers' size in the traversal to the
		  correct node position:
			- x.Size = x.Size + 1 (within the loop to the correct
			  empty	pointer position)
* New Methods for OrderStatisticTree:
	- OS-Select(x,i): selects (and returns) the i-th order statistic from the tree rooted
	  at Node x
	- OS-RANK(T,x): returns the rank of the node x in the context of the
	  OrderStatisticTree T
