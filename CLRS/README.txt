This project intends to implement applicable pseudocode and data structure outlines into functional C++ code. 
General intentions: 
* To create templatized implementations of data structures, when applicable. ( Specific necessary operator definitions will be outlined. )  
* To avoid using the std namespace/data structures from the STL. 
  - Exceptions: 
      * (<iostream> <string> ) std::cout, std::string for printing cases.
      * (<cmath>) std::log2() for comparisons to theoretically bounds
      * (<random>) std::rand() for generation of pseudo-random data sets
