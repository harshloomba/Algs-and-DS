This project intends to implement applicable pseudocode and data structure outlines into functional C++ code. 
General intentions: 
* To create templatized implementations of data structures, when applicable. ( Specific necessary operator definitions will be outlined. )  
* To avoid using the std namespace/data structures from the STL. Exception: std::cout for printing cases.
